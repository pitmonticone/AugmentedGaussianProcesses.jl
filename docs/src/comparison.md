# Julia GP Package Comparison

## AugmentedGaussianProcesses.jl vs [Stheno.jl](https://github.com/willtebbutt/Stheno.jl) vs [GaussianProcesses.jl](https://github.com/STOR-i/GaussianProcesses.jl)

There are already two other Gaussian Process packages in Julia, however their feature are quite orthogonal. They are roughly compared here:
AGP.jl stands for AugmentedGaussianProcesses.jl and GP.jl for GaussianProcesses.jl
